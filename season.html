    <h1>Seasons in Japan</h1>

    <h1>Spring / 春 (<em>haru</em>)</h1>

    <p>After a harsh winter, springtime in Japan is a popular time to travel, when cherry blossoms bloom from late March to early April. People congregate under trees to celebrate the beauty of cherry blossoms, a phenomenon known as hanami, which is observed throughout the country. As they celebrate Japanese ancestry and culture, the lion dancers' procession brings excitement and a sense of togetherness.</p>
    
    <h1>Summer / 夏 (<em>natsu</em>)</h1>

    <p>Japan's summer season is defined by both traditional and contemporary festivals, such as Osaka's Tenjin Festival, Tokyo's Shinjuku Eisa Festival, and Kyoto's Gion Festival. These festivities frequently include fireworks, which heightens the enchanted ambiance. The lion dancers' parade heightens the intensity, as the Japanese word for heat is "atsui."</p>

    <h1>Autumn / 秋 (<em>aki</em>)</h1>
    <img src="images&videos/autumn.jpg" alt="Autumn in Japan">
    <p>In Japan, autumn is a lovely time of year when the deciduous trees change from green to fiery red. With drier weather and harvest celebrations, it lasts from September to November. The National Festival of Rice takes place to the greatest extent.</p>

    <h1>Winter / 冬 (<em>fuyu</em>)</h1>
    <img src="images&videos/winter.jpg" alt="Winter in Japan">
    <p>Winters in Japan are harsh, with more snowfall than anyplace else; as a result, people spend more time indoors instead of outdoors. Skiing, snow festivals, and handcrafted snow sculptures are all available in the winter. The Shinkansen makes it simple to travel from Tokyo to ski destinations. Major holidays such as New Year's Day and Coming of Age Day are also observed in Japan.</p>
